# Devin Harris' work through of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Foundations Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/)
## Installation Overview
- It's important to learn how to setup an **actual** development environment even though online in-browser editors can be helpful
- Running a Mac makes this easy because Odin Project assumes a unix-based system
  - Windows is not **OFFICIALLY** supported, we could use Windows with virtualization but Odin Project doesn't officially support it
## Text Editors
- We need to use a **true** **plain-text** code editor 
  -  There are a number of code editors but the Odin Project officially recommends using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  -  Odin Project links out to [Microsoft's Basics Video Series on VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)
## Command Line Basics
- It's important for a developer to know how to navigate around and interact with the computer through a command-line interface or terminal
- Odin Project walked through setting up the VS Code `code` invocation from terminal in VS Code
- Provided some great resources for working from the command line

## Setting up Git
- Git is the most popular **version control system**, [GitHub](https://github.com/) is the most popular service with Git but GitHub is not Git
- We setup git
- We sign up for GitHub
- We create an SSH key
- We link that key with GitHub
- We test the SSH connection between GitHub and our machine
## Introduction to Git 
- The Odin Project walks us through version control with Git
- Git works on the local machine, we use GitHub as a remote repository where we can push Git files to
