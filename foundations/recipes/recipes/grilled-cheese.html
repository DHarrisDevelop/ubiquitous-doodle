      <LI>
        Spread butter on one side of each piece of bread
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Place the buttered bread so the buttered sides are touching and the unbuttered side is showing on the top bread
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Place cheese slice(s) on the top bread
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Preheat the frypan using the heat source to medium high heat
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Once preheated, place the top slice of bread with the cheese on the fry pan buttered side down
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Using spatula periodically move the bread around the frypan to ensure the bread doesn't burn
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Once the cheese starts getting melty, place the second bread on-top of the cheese with the unbuttered side touching the cheese and the buttered side up
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Using the spatula, flip the sandwhich over so that you are now cooking the uncooked piece of bread
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Using the spatula continue to move the sandwhich so that the bread doesn't get burned
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Once both sides are grilled to your liking, serve the sandwhich - recommend cutting this in half
